# gitlab-webhook

This is a NodeJS/ExpressJS server that listens to events from a Gitlab server.  

The purpose of the project is to automate the transfer of Jira tickets, to ensure that QA always had an up-to-date list of features to test, rather than relying on developers to remember to transfer all the issues themselves.
